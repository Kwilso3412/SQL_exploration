# Data-Solstice Gaming SQL exploration 
Along with two other classmates we created this fictional data analysis gaming company. 

-	Mission Statement:
    * We at Data-Solstice gaming make it our mission to create only games our players care about. Our goal is to only produce titles that our players care about and want to come back to play.
-	Background information of the fictional company:
    * We founded our company because we noticed that most gamers were complaining about games being buggy or becoming repetitive and boring after a week. That is why we made it our mission to only deliver quality     content for our users.
